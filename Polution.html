  <b>What is air pollution ?</b>  
<br>
    Air pollution kills an estimated seven million people worldwide every year. WHO(wolrd health organisation) data shows that 9 out of 10 people breathe air containing high levels of pollutants. WHO is working with countries to monitor air pollution and improve air quality.  
  <br>
    From smog hanging over cities to smoke inside the home, air pollution poses a major threat to health and climate. The combined effects of ambient (outdoor) and household air pollution cause about seven million premature deaths every year, largely as a result of increased mortality from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and acute respiratory infections. 
<br>
    More than 80% of people living in urban areas that monitor air pollution are exposed to air quality levels that exceed WHO guideline limits, with low- and middle-income countries suffering from the highest exposures, both indoors and outdoors. 
<br>
 <b> Causes of air pollution</b>  
  <ol>
  <li>The burning of fossil fuels </li>
  <li> Agricultural activities </li>
  
  <li>Exhaust from factories and industries </li>
  
  <li> Mining operations </li>
  
  <li> Indoor air pollution </li>
  </ol>
  
  <b>Effects of Air pollution</b> 
  <ol>
  <li>Respiratory and heart problems</li> 
  <li>Global warming</li> 
  <li>Acid rain</li> 
  <li>Eutrophication</li> 
  <li>Effect on wildlife</li> 
  <li>Depletion of the ozone layer</li> 
  </ol>
  <b> Solutions For Air Pollution </b>
  <ol>
    <li>Use public mode of transportation </li> 
    <li>Conserve energy</li> 
    <li>Understand the concept of Reduce, Reuse and Recycle</li> 
    <li>Emphasis on clean energy resources </li> 
    <li>Use energy efficient devices</li>

  <b>What is water pollution?</b> 
<br>
  Water pollution occurs when harmful substances—often chemicals or microorganisms—contaminate a stream, river, lake, ocean, aquifer, or other body of water, degrading water quality and rendering it toxic to humans or the environment. 
  <br>
  <b>What Are the Causes of Water Pollution?</b> 
  <br>
  Water is uniquely vulnerable to pollution. Known as a “universal solvent,” water is able to dissolve more substances than any other liquid on earth. It’s the reason we have Kool-Aid and brilliant blue waterfalls. It’s also why water is so easily polluted. Toxic substances from farms, towns, and factories readily dissolve into and mix with it, causing water pollution. 
  <br>
  <b>What Are the Effects of Water Pollution?</b> 
  <ul>
  <li>On human health:</li> 
  
  To put it bluntly: Water pollution kills. In fact, it caused 1.8 million deaths in 2015, according to a study published in The Lancet. Contaminated water can also make you ill. Every year, unsafe water sickens about 1 billion people. And low-income communities are disproportionately at risk because their homes are often closest to the most polluting industries. 
  
  <li>On the environment:</li> 
  
  In order to thrive, healthy ecosystems rely on a complex web of animals, plants, bacteria, and fungi—all of which interact, directly or indirectly, with each other. Harm to any of these organisms can create a chain effect, imperiling entire aquatic environments. 
  </ul>
  <b>What Can You Do to Prevent Water Pollution?</b> 
  <br>
  It’s easy to tsk-tsk the oil company with a leaking tanker, but we’re all accountable to some degree for today’s water pollution problem. Fortunately, there are some simple ways you can prevent water contamination or at least limit your contribution to it: 
  <ul>
  <li>Reduce your plastic consumption and reuse or recycle plastic when you can. </li>
  
  <li>Properly dispose of chemical cleaners, oils, and non-biodegradable items to keep them from ending up down the drain. </li>
  
  <li>Maintain your car so it doesn’t leak oil, antifreeze, or coolant. </li>
  
  <li>If you have a yard, consider landscaping that reduces runoff and avoid applying pesticides and herbicides. </li>
  
  <li>If you have a pup, be sure to pick up its poop.</li> 	
  </ul>
